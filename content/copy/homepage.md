Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maddie, a software developer who builds cool apps using React, Python, and containers. Currently, I work at Postscript (YC W19) as a fullstack engineer on an e-commerce SMS marketing platform. Before, I built and managed an international, multi-platform e-commerce analytics tool on Kubernetes. I am always open to new opportunities where I can create elegant solutions and cooperate with a diverse team.

In my free time, I like growing houseplants, hiking near Los Angeles, LGBTQ+ advocacy, and adding more static analysis tools to my CI/CD pipelines. There's also a [smattering of projects](https://github.com/madelyneriksen/) on my Github profile that I work on.

If you're interested in hiring a developer experience with Python, Javascript, and Kubernetes, or just want to say hi, please [reach out](/contact/) and get in touch! I'd love to hear from you. You can also [check out](/blog/) some of the things I have written.

See you around!
