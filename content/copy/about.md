I'm a fullstack developer living and working in Los Angeles. I work on a stack of Python, React, and *nix technologies.

I first started programming on Python 2.7 back in 2012, creating programs to help me solve my math homework. In highschool I got my first linux computer: a Raspberry Pi dev board.

Now, I'm spending my time creating data collection systems for ecommerce and working on freelance projects. When I'm not programming, I like to hike trails around Los Angeles and adopt additional houseplants.

You can find some code samples, designs, and creations of mine [over at my github.](https://github.com/madelyneriksen/) I'm also interested in hearing of new opportunities, partnering up with another developer, or taking on additional freelance work.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions, or just want to say hello! Cheers!
